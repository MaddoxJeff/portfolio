#INFO

This was a project assigned me during a recent interview.  The program should request a widgets dimensions "X,Y,Z"
Select parts that pull a price from a txt file.
Then display the new price from the parts that are selected, and from the dimensions.
A receipt should be created under receipt.txt with customers information.
A database should also be updated with information from the user.


#IMPROVEMENTS
- Need to change the TextBox that reveals values for volume and price to "read only"
- Invoice number should be auto generated, not inserted by the user
- Give the widgets dimensions the ability to stop and change to create a shape like a 3D plus sign
